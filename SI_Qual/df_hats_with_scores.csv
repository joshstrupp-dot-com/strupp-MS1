The hat is painted dark green overall, and the front bears a painted image of a spread-winged eagle, grasping an olive branch in one talon and three arrows in the other, with a golden harp hanging from a chain in its beak. There is a red banner on top of the image with the text “HIBERNIA” in gold. The image is reminiscent of the bald eagle on the seal of the United States, but the harp as a symbol of Ireland replaces the U.S. shield. The imagery points to the Hibernia Fire Company blending its Irish heritage with American patriotic ideals. The back of the hat has the date “1752” painted in gold. The Hibernia Fire Engine Company No. 1 was founded in 1752 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as a hand engine company.
