# Somewhere in Maryland

“Somewhere in Maryland” tells the story of the Smithsonian’s Museum Support Center where most of SI’s collection lives. Using data from the Natural History Museum (namely, vertebrates and invertebrates), we scroll into four different jars that contain data points as “specimens.” Using a symbol plot and manually selecting the most interesting specimens, viewers can drill down to see one of the millions of jarred fish, lizards and squids. The datasets include taxonomy, collection date, physical descriptions, where they were discovered, and more!

# Pallette of Hirshhorn

The tools of an artist have evolved over time. Today, most of us use Photoshop and Figma before hitting the wood shop. “Pallette of Hirshhorn” dives into the freetext > “content” that includes materials to aggregate which artwork is made of which material. Simply select by the material (a la Photoshop tools) and see the results as well as the total count. Drill deeper to see where that material appears over the course of time, and when exactly that piece was made.

# Uncut Dupes 

Riding the heels of the “dupe culture” phenomena, “Uncut Dupes” is reminiscent of a poorly designed web 1.0 e-commerce website (think Word Art meets “As Seen On TV”). Within the Mineral Sciences dataset there are thousands of gemstones — gemstones that are actually sold on Etsy. Users can explore a selection of Smithsonian’s gem collection, explore where in the world it was found as a pie chart, and its attributes (color, cut, and weight) vs. the rest of the collection as barbells. And if you click “Buy Dupe Now,” you’re taken to a query on Etsy’s website, leaving you explore Smithsonian knock offs.

# Smithsooooooooonian
Across almost every dataset, there is something called “physicalDescription.” This contains things like dimensions, weight, and number of pages if the entry is a book. Hypothetically, if we normalized this data and added it up, we’d have the rough spatial size of what the Smithsonian has preserved. It’d be bigger than things we all recognize as big... like the Empire State Building or the Great Pyramids or maybe even a small planet! Smithsoooooonian tries to answer the question “how big is their collection really?” by comparing it to really big things.
